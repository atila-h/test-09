                <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer at heart and produce features
                    that are best suited for the job at hand.</p>

                <p>"Full stack" is a term in software development that refers to the ability and experience in
                    developing
                    both main parts of a website or application, namely the front-end and back-end.

            <p>Frontend
                Frontend refers to the parts of a website that users can directly interact with. In simpler terms,
                frontend is what the user sees and interacts with.</p>
            <h3>Frontend technologies include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>HTML</b> (Website structure)</li>
                <li><b>CSS</b> (Appearance, design, and styling)</li>
                <li><b>JavaScript</b> (Interactions and behaviors on the web)</li>
                <li>Frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, Vue.js</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="img">
            <div class="backend"></div>
            <p>Backend refers to the parts of a website that operate behind the scenes. This section is responsible
                for
                storing data, processing requests, managing databases, and performing tasks essential for the
                websiteâ€™s
                proper functionality, but the user does not interact with it directly.</p>
            <h3>Backend technologies include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming languages like Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Ruby, PHP, Java, C#</li>

        <div class="img">
            <div class="dev"></div>
            <p>A Full Stack Developer must have the ability to integrate frontend and backend. This involves working
                with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and coordinating between the client (frontend) and
                the
                server (backend).

            <ul>
                <li><b>Sver and Web Hosting Managementer</b> (e.g., AWS, Azure, Docker)</li>

            <span>
                A website is a collection of web pages that are typically accessible through a domain name or a unique
                internet address (URL). Websites present various types of information in the form of text, images,
                videos,
                and other digital resources. Websites are usually created for different purposes, such as providing
                information, selling products and services, education, or entertainment. A website can consist of one or
                more pages that are regularly connected to each other.

                Websites are essential tools for interacting with the online world. They can serve diverse goals,
                including
                information dissemination, sales, social engagement, or even entertainment. Having a website is crucial
                for
                any business or individual who wants to establish a presence in the digital space.

            <h2>Pros of a good site</h2>
            <span>Ease of use on a website, also known as User Experience (UX), is one of the key factors for the
                success of
                any website. A website that is easy to use and navigate can lead to increased user engagement, reduced
                bounce rates, and an overall improvement in the visitor's experience.

                Ease of use is essential for attracting and retaining users. With a simple design, easy access, fast
                performance, and responsiveness to user needs, a flawless and positive experience can be provided for
